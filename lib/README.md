# Bison parser
This file is auto-generated by Bison, based on the grammar defined in the grammar.y file in the root of this project.

To rebuild the parser you'll need docker or Bison installed locally.

## Rebuild the parser
To build with docker, run:
```shell
# Assuming that your $PWD is the project root, run:
composer rebuild-parser
```
To build locally, install Bison in your SO and run:
```shell
# Assuming that your $PWD is the project root, run:
bison -S vendor/mrsuh/php-bison-skeleton/src/php-skel.m4 -o lib/parser.php grammar.y -Wcounterexamples
```
After the build, you need to change the `yyreportSyntaxError` method in the parser.php file, to format the error message like this:
```php
private function yyreportSyntaxError(Context $yyctx): void {
  $this->yyerror($this->buildErrorMessage($yyctx));
}
```
